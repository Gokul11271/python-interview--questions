# 🧩 LEVEL 1 — Basics & Indexing

# These teach how to access, search, and manipulate arrays.

# Find element index

# Input: arr = [5,8,3,9,1], target = 9

# Output: 3

# 👉 Use a loop or .index().

# Find the maximum and minimum element

# Output both value and index.

# 👉 Loop through array, compare, store best.

# Count even and odd numbers

# Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

# Output: even=3, odd=3

# Sum and average of all elements

# Output: total sum and average value.

# Reverse the array

# Without using built-in reverse methods.

# 👉 Use two-pointer swapping or slicing.
